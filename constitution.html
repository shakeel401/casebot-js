                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This article creates the legislative branch, dividing it into two chambers—the House of Representatives and the Senate—with frequent elections to ensure accountability and responsiveness. It lays out specific qualifications for office based on activity and citizenship in the roleplay group, while also detailing how bills become laws, the process for impeachment, and the powers vested in Congress. Municipalities are restricted from conducting foreign affairs, issuing currency, or maintaining military forces without federal oversight, reinforcing a strong centralized authority. The article also introduces procedural structures, quorum requirements, and committee formation to support legislative operations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This article outlines how constitutional amendments are proposed and adopted. It gives Congress the power to initiate changes with a two-thirds vote in both chambers, but requires review and approval by a majority of the Supreme Court within ten days. If the Court rejects an amendment, Congress may override that decision by securing two-thirds approval from both chambers again. This dual-step process balances democratic initiative with judicial oversight, ensuring thoughtful and lawful constitutional evolution.</p>
